In this folder you can find two datasets, both in .csv and .dta format:

- country_level_data -> contains data at the country-sector level, following WIOD structure.
- ntus2_level_data -> contains data at the nuts2 level, already weighted using regional employment (SBS) weights.

The HTML file "All countries Bubble" contains the interactive version of Figure 3 (Nuts-2 level Bubble Chart): download the file in .html format and open it in your favorite browser to explore the graph.
